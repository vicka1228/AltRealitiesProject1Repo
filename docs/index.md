# The Ruined Throne

You are in the middle of a throne room which seems completely deserted and dilapidated (medieval fantasy world)
Decades ago, this kingdom used to be alive. But they suffered under the wrath of a greedy king with dark powers.
The prince, with similar powers of his own, rebelled against his father in an attempt to bring him down. But something backfired very badly and they both vanished with only their essence left there, and the throne room cracked down its middle.
The few people present in the court turned to statues. The kingdom/city was soon abandoned by its people because all the lands turned infertile.

## The Process

These are my initial sketches and first progress report phase:

The throne room was pretty much rebuilt entirely after this first progress report. One thing I really struggled with was the scaling, as I wanted a large throne room but turns out I had made things much bigger than they needed to be. I also chose a scene where the lighting was non-existent in my head, so I didn't know how to incorporate that.

Overall, I wish I had found more assets in the Unity store which fit my theme (for free). One thing I would really like to learn is making my own assets in something other than ProBuilder. And I wish the lovers concept could have been incorporated too (iykyk) but I really couldn't find the elements the way I would have wanted and frankly, ran out of time.
